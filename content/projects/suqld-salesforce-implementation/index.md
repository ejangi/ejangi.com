This was the largest technical project that SU QLD had undertaken and comprised a 3-year, 6-phase programme of change.

I worked alongside my director to create the business case and work out a model for project payback.

After completing PRINCE2 training, we setup the project, selected the vendors and set about working with stakeholders to create excitement and gather in-depth requirements.

After 18 months of implementation and data migration work, we moved all of the fundraising functions from Blackbaud Raiser's Edge to Salesforce and started working towards bringing our marketing functions into [Salesforce Marketing Cloud]({{< relref "suqld-salesforce-marketing-cloud.md" >}}).
