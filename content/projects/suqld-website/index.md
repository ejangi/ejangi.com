Working with an agency to complete the design and ensure the main website for SU QLD best represented it to various stakeholders.

{{< figure src="images/suqld-website.png" title="SU QLD's Wordpress Website Homepage" >}}

Due to time-constraints we decided to outsource the initial design and build to a design agency. To that end it was vital that the agency had a comprehensive understanding of the organisation, it's stakeholders and the requirements.

Once the Wordpress template was created, I took over the development to complete the more intricate integrations with internal systems and build out a CI/CD pipeline for pushing changes through staging into production.
