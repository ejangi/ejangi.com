This project was a collaboration between 8 School Chaplaincy service providers around Australia. The campaign was intended to fill some vacancies in schools as quickly as possible.

Using search and social advertising, we drove traffic to a Marketing Cloud landing page which created leads in Salesforce and allocated the leads to the correct organisation for further triage and follow up.
