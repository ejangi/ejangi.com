Project Management of SU QLD's transition from Campaign Monitor to Salesforce Marketing Cloud.

{{< figure src="/images/corporate-lapsing-series-journey.png" title="SU QLD's Corporate Lapsing Series Journey" >}}

I coordinated the Marketing, Fundraising and Programs teams, along with the Salesforce consultants and the Marketing Cloud consultants to ensure everyone transitioned successfully.
