Project Management of SU QLD's transition from Blackbaud Raiser's Edge to Salesforce.

{{< figure src="/images/suqld-salesforce-dashboard.png" title="SU QLD's Salesforce Homepage" >}}

This was the largest technical project that SU QLD had undertaken and comprised a 3-year, 6-phase programme of change.

I worked alongside my director to create the business case and work out a model for project payback.

After completing PRINCE2 training, we setup a complete project, selected the vendors and set about working with stakeholders to create excitement and gather in-depth requirements.

After 18 months of implementation and data migration work, we moved all of our fundraising functions into Salesforce and started working towards bringing our marketing functions into [Salesforce Marketing Cloud]({{< relref "suqld-salesforce-marketing-cloud.md" >}}).

## Key Involvement

* Requirements gathering and user story development.
* Stakeholder Engagement to help create excitement and manage expectations.
* Working with internal teams and external consultants to implement and transition data.
* Some implementation, including custom development.
