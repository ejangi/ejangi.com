Having topped my IT classes at school and going on to study multimedia, I started building websites professionally in 2001.

In 2008, I joined the team at a non-profit — SU QLD — and have been working in various roles since.

As Service Evolution Manager my role is similar to a Business Analyst, in that I help teams to see beyond the next step and design business plans and transformation projects. However, I also do some data analysis and implementation work.
