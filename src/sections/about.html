                <p><strong>I believe in putting people first.</strong> In every project I make sure technology hurdles don&rsquo;t get in the way of giving people what they want&sbquo; in a way that makes sense to them.</p>
                <p>Some people call this usability or user experience...</p>
                <p>I just call it <em>being human</em>.</p>

                <p>Web development is my core-strength. But, as you would expect from a Multimedia graduate&sbquo; I also have skills in photography&sbquo; film&sbquo; audio production&sbquo; animation and online marketing strategy.</p>
                <p>As a team leader I believe in empowering people to do great work. <em>&lsquo;Wind people up and let them go&rsquo;</em> is my mantra. But&sbquo; I also believe in honest feedback and doing what it takes to get the best result for the organisation.</p>
                <p>Suffice it to say&sbquo; I&rsquo;m no stranger to taking a project from blank slate to finished product and making sure it gets results.</p>
